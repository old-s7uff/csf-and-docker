# CSF AND DOCKER
If you have already open ports in csf.conf and you still can't connect to container use this

PS, Make sure you haven't any different rule for "DOCKER" Chain. or may this will fail!

```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/systemroot/csf-and-docker/master/install.sh```

```sh install.sh```

Then simply try to connect container again..
